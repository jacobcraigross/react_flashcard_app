IMO flash cards are very useful. I decided to create an app that replaces my many decks of analog cards! 

This app will be useful to those who want to learn Python and Javascript. On one side will be a simple syntax problem and on the other side, the code (ie: the solution). There are a few things that need to be just muscle memory. These cards will help train that muscle memory.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
